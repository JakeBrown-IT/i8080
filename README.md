# i8080
An Intel-8080 Emulator written in C. 

This project follows along with the guide on the Emulator 101 website: https://web.archive.org/web/20240718053956/http://emulator101.com/ and it purely for learning purposes to test and improve my abilities in using C, and furthering my knowledge of the CPU at machine level.
